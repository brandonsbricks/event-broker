EventBroker

EventBroker allows you to receive/transmit data across classes with minimized class coupling.

EventBroker provides an interface and premade implementations of the event broker software architecture pattern. Feel free to write a custom implementation with the same interface.

Premade implementations include:
1. Static event broker
2. Local instance event broker

Inspired by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas's description of the event broker pattern in their book, The Pragmattic Programmer.
This package is written by Brandon Rivera-Melo.
